				<h1>Details</h1>
				<h2>Creating income from information</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Inspirational people are also busy people. They don't necessarily have time to put a book together, so we'll extract their thoughts and ghostwrite it for them, adding in additional insight, research and references.</li>
                <li>Books will be co-branded, providing reach to the networks of those involved and opportunities (through in-book advertising) to meet the objectives of the publisher and contributor.</li>
                <li>Sold through an online store (modelled roughly on <a href="http://www.abookapart.com">abookapart.com</a>), books would be optimised for all popular eReader formats, with print-on-demand options available for those who'd prefer a physical product.</li>
